# **Domain Expert Model Fine-Tuning**

This project demonstrates the fine-tuning of a large language model (LLM) to adapt it for domain-specific text generation. Using **AWS SageMaker**, **Meta's LLaMA 2 7B model** was fine-tuned with domain-specific data and optimized using techniques such as **prompt engineering**, **hyperparameter tuning**, and **natural language processing (NLP)** strategies to enhance performance and applicability in real-world domain applications.

## **Key Features**
- **Pretrained Meta LLaMA 2 7B model fine-tuned for domain-specific applications.**
  
- **Custom prompts created to guide the model towards generating relevant responses specific to the domain.**
  
- **Optimization of hyperparameters to improve model accuracy and response coherence.**
  
- **Used AWS SageMaker's powerful compute resources for training and model deployment.**

- **Model Notebooks**:
  - **Before Fine-Tuning**: Contains the code for loading and initializing the pre-trained model.
  - **After Fine-Tuning**: Contains the code that demonstrates the fine-tuned model's ability to generate domain-specific text.
